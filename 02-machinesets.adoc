# Review OpenShift Configuration

## MachineSets and Machines

Kubernetes `Nodes` are where containers are orchestrated and run in `Pods`.
OpenShift 4 is fundamentally different than OpenShift 3 with respect to its
focus on automated operations through the use of `Operators`. With respect
to `Nodes`, there is a set of `Operators` and controllers that are focused on
maintaining the state of the cluster size -- including creating and
destroying `Nodes`!

. The `MachineSet` defines a desired state for a set of `Machine` objects. When
using IPI installations, then, there is an `Operator` whose job it is to make
sure that there is actually an underlying instance for each `Machine` and,
finally, that every `Machine` becomes a `Node`.
+
Execute the following:
+
[source,bash,role="execute"]
----
oc get machineset -n openshift-machine-api
----
+
You will see something like:
+
[source,bash,role="execute"]
----
NAME                                           DESIRED   CURRENT   READY   AVAILABLE   AGE
cluster-754d-js4cq-worker-eu-west-1a           1         1         1       1           7h38m
cluster-754d-js4cq-worker-eu-west-1b           1         1         1       1           7h38m
cluster-754d-js4cq-worker-eu-west-1c           1         1         1       1           7h38m
----

. When OpenShift was installed, the installer interrogated the cloud provider
to learn about the available AZs (since this is on AWS). It then ultimately
created a `MachineSet` for each AZ and then scaled those sets, in order,
until it reached the desired number of `Machines`. Since the default
installation has 3 workers, the first 3 AZs got one worker each. The rest got
zero.

### Cluster Scaling
Because of the magic of `Operators` and the way in which OpenShift uses them
to manage `Machines` and `Nodes`, scaling your cluster in OpenShift 4 is
extremely trivial.

Look at the list of `MachineSets` again:

[source,bash,role="execute"]
----
oc get machineset -n openshift-machine-api
----

Within that list, we will scale one of the `MachineSet` objects with the
`oc scale` command. Run:

[source,bash,role="execute"]
----
CLUSTERNAME=$(oc get  infrastructures.config.openshift.io cluster  -o jsonpath='{.status.infrastructureName}')
ZONENAME=$(oc get nodes -L topology.kubernetes.io/zone  --no-headers  | awk '{print $NF}' | tail -1)
oc scale machineset ${CLUSTERNAME}-worker-${ZONENAME} -n openshift-machine-api --replicas=2
----

Take special note the `MachineSet` scaled is likely different from
the one that is shown in the lab guide. You should see a note that the
`MachineSet` was successfully scaled. Now, look at the list of `Machines`:

[source,bash,role="execute"]
----
oc get machines -n openshift-machine-api
----

You probably already have a new entry for a `Machine` with a `STATE` of
`Pending`. After a few moments, it will have a corresponding EC2 instance ID
and will look something like:

----
cluster-f4a3-lpxbs-worker-us-east-2c-h7gdt   i-0b9208ec47f0e206b   running   m5.2xlarge     eu-west-1   eu-west-1c   47s
----

At this point, in the background, the bootstrap process is happening
automatically. After several minutes (up to five or so), take a look at the
output of:

[source,bash,role="execute"]
----
oc get nodes
----

You should see your fresh and happy new node as the one with a very young age:

----
ip-10-0-166-103.eu-west-1.compute.internal   Ready    worker   1m   v1.16.2
----

[Note]
====
It can take several minutes for a `Machine` to be prepared and added
as a `Node`. You can follow the process by running a `watch` against
`oc get nodes` if you wish.
====

Scale the `MachineSet` from two back down to one before continuing.

[Warning]
====
Make sure you've set the ${CLUSTERNAME} and ${ZONENAME} varaible from
when you scaled up, a few steps ago.
====

[source,bash,role="execute"]
----
oc scale machineset ${CLUSTERNAME}-worker-${ZONENAME} -n openshift-machine-api --replicas=1
----
